# **Time Series Forecasting with Transformers**  
_Master’s thesis project – Robust forecasting across heterogeneous datasets_

## 🚀 Overview
This project explores the application of **Transformer models** to time series forecasting, comparing them against classical approaches and gradient boosting models on datasets with varying characteristics (frequency, exogenous variables, missing data, outliers).  
Goal: understand **when** and **why** Transformers outperform traditional methods.

## 📊 Project Contents
- ✔️ Advanced preprocessing (lag features, scaling, missing-value handling)  
- ✔️ Transformer implementation for forecasting  
- ✔️ Comparison with ARIMA, XGBoost, and baseline models  
- ✔️ **h=1** (recursive) and **multistep** forecasts  
- ✔️ Evaluation with **MASE**  
- ✔️ Cross-dataset performance analysis  
- ✔️ Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna  

## 🧠 Why this project?
Transformers are reshaping forecasting. This project highlights their strengths, limitations, and the real-world conditions where they generalize better than traditional models.
